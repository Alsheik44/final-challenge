# Project title: MYTOKEN.
# Discription
This Solidity project is a simple "TOKEN" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of mint and bunt function. The purpose of this program is to highlight you  on how create to your very first TOKEN. This project is a simple smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This project serves as a simple and straightforward introduction on how how create a simple TOKEN

Getting Started
Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MYTOKEN.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

    //SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public  tokenName = "BITNAIRA";
    string public  tokenAbr = "BTN";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
    totalSupply += _value;
    balances[_address] += _value;
}

    // burn function
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public{
    if(balances[_address] >= _value){
        totalSupply -= _value;
        balances[_address] -= _value;

    }
    }
}
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "MyToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "sayHello" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the "MyToken!" message.
